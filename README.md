## Commit.js

This is a simple Node.js script that generates a random number of text files, commits them to a local git repository, and then pushes them to a remote repository.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following Node.js packages:

- fs: This is a built-in Node.js package for file system operations.
- simple-git: A lightweight interface for running git commands in any Node.js application.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you don't have these installed, you can download them from <u>_[here](https://nodejs.org/)_</u>.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install simple-git
```

Usage
To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the Commit.js file in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
node Commit.js
```

This will generate a random number of text files (between 7 and 11), commit them to your local git repository, and then push them to the 'main' branch of your remote repository.

Please ensure that you have a git repository initialized in your project directory and that you have set up a remote repository to push to.

Note
This script assumes that you have write access to the directory it's being run in, as it needs to create and write to text files. If you encounter any permission errors, you may need to run the script with elevated permissions.
